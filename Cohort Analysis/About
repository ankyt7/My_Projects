Cohort Analysis
-By Ankit Kumar

>Dataset
Data used in this project is of “Online Retail Data Set” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This is a transaction data set containing all the transaction between 12/01/2010 and 12/09/2011 for UK-based online retail. The number of instances is around 5 lacs. It is a relatively clean data set for exploring the usability and testing for customer behavior, especially for cohort analysis.

>Cohort Analysis is a powerful tool for tracking user behaviors on the product. It is highly flexible. The time period can be changed from month to week even day-basis. Multiple metrics can be used in the diverse behavioral measurement.

>Project Workflow :

    -Dataset exploration and cleaning
    -Create a cohort
    -Visualize the cohort analysis
